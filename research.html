                <p><b>Experiment:</b></p>
                <p>
                    I am broadly interested in heavy-ion physics. My research mainly focuses on the ALICE experiment at CERN. 
                    I was actively involved in the analysis of \(\psi(2S)\) polarization measurement in pp collisions at center of mass energy 13 TeV. 
                    The quarkonium polarization in high-energy hadronic collisions can provide tests for Quantum Chromodynamics. Currently, various theoretical models give contrasting results with the experimental data for charmonia polarization. 
                    Thus, a detailed study with a higher center of mass energy and higher statistics is necessary. Moreover, the \(\psi(2S)\) polarization study is important because the \(\psi(2S)\) signal is almost uncontaminated from the decays of higher charmonium states, giving a clear result of polarization. 
                    Thus, this study can act as a baseline for quarkonium polarization measurements in high multiplicity hadronic and heavy-ion collisions, where there can be a possibility of contribution from spin-orbit coupling, which is an indirect consequence of a thermalized deconfined medium formation. 
                    In the analysis, we extract the polarization parameters by studying the angular distribution of the two-body decay daughters of charmonia. Two specific frames of references are chosen in the \(\psi(2S)\) rest mass frame, namely the helicity and Collins-Soper frames. 
                    Finally, the polarization parameters are studied in these two reference frames as functions of transverse momentum. I mainly work with the AliPhysics framework, which was used for the data analysis of RUN 1 and RUN 2 data obtained by the ALICE collaboration. 
                    In addition to this, I am also involved in a service task to check the compatibility of RUN 2 converted data to the O2 framework, which is being used for the RUN 3 data analysis. I am also involved in and guiding new PhD students who are working on \(\Upsilon(nS)\) and \(\phi\) polarization in the dimuon channel with RUN3 data.

                <p><b>Phenomenology:</b></p>
                <p>
                    On the phenomenological side, my work concerns with possible QGP droplet formation in high multiplicity proton-proton collisions. 
                    I work with QCD-inspired models, such as the color string percolation model (CSPM), which can provide useful information about the thermodynamics and transport properties of the matter formed in ultra-relativistic collisions. 
                    Our work suggests a threshold of charged particle multiplicity per pseudorapidity density of around 10-20, after which a possible deconfined medium formation can be expected. This makes the study of high multiplicity pp collisions very intriguing. 
                    I also work on non-extensive Tsallis statistics, which assumes a slightly off-equilibrium system to study various thermodynamic and transport properties of a hadronic medium. These studies can help us to characterize the matter formed in ultra-relativistic collisions. 
                    In addition, I am currently working with an interacting hadron resonance gas model to study various thermodynamic and transport properties by considering the effect of both an external magnetic field and rotation in the system. This also can be used to understand the conserved charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions. 
                    Recent studies on hyperon polarization in heavy-ion collisions have opened new avenues regarding the presence and effect of rotation in the medium. In accordance with the effect of vorticity, I am also exploring hyperon and quarkonium polarization studies in ultra-relativistic collisions by using various phenomenological models. 
                    Overall, the study of the QCD phase structure gets more interesting with the addition of extra dimensions such as magnetic field and rotation. I also explore the QCD phase diagram through the interacting hadron resonance gas model to try to constrain the location of both the QCD critical point and the liquid-gas critical point.
